# Random-Forest
 It is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each decision tree is trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the features, hence the name "random forest."
It is a popular and powerful technique known for its robustness and high accuracy in handling complex datasets.
Random Forest Classification works by creating an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data, and feature subsets are randomly selected for each tree. The algorithm introduces randomness in two ways: bagging and feature sampling.
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation): The random forest algorithm generates multiple subsets of the training data through a process called bootstrapping. Bootstrapping involves randomly sampling the data with replacement, resulting in each subset having the same number of instances as the original dataset. Each subset is then used to train an individual decision tree.
Feature Sampling: For each decision tree in the random forest, a random subset of features is selected as candidates for splitting at each node. This helps introduce diversity among the trees and prevents any single feature from dominating the decision-making process.
During the classification phase, each decision tree in the random forest independently predicts the class label for a given input instance. The final prediction is determined by aggregating the individual predictions from all the trees. In a majority vote scenario, the class that receives the most votes across all the trees is assigned as the predicted class label.
Random Forest Classification offers several advantages: Robustness, Accuracy, Variable Importance, Handling Missing Data
Random Forest Classification has applications in various domains, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and image recognition. It is well-suited for complex classification problems and situations where accurate predictions and robustness are desired.
